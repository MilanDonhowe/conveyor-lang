Once I finish up all the points on the todo-list I plan to submit this
language to the esoteric language wiki.


TODO:
--> Tidy Up && Modularize Code
--> Upload to GitHub w/Docs
--> Possibly move to a better parsing method... 
    \-> maybe use a parser combinator library like "parsec"

--> Add floating point support 
    \->(should it be by its own queue or combined with the numeric?)


Finished:
--> subroutines now have their own operator queue
--> Removed hacky rewind operator "!" in favor of recursive subroutines for looping.
